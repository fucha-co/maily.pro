Cheaper than @yourdomain
There are many prices to pay when using @yourdomain email — domain registration, domain hosting, email hosting, and/or Microsoft Exchange fees. Instead, use yourname@maily.pro and save money.

Easier than @yourdomain
Maily.pro saves you a tonne of time and headaches — you don't need to register a domain, set-up hosting, or configure and manage email servers. Instead, use yourname@maily.pro and just breathe easy.

More professional than Gmail, Hotmail & Ymail
Using @gmail or @hotmail is not a professional look. Using @maily.pro is a professional email address — and an enterprise email system! — without the costs and hassles. Now you look and sound professional.
